### C. The Legend of Freya the Frog

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int x, y, k;
        cin>>x>>y>>k;
        int ans = 0;
        int mini = INT_MAX;
        int maxi = 0;
        int x_step = ceil(x/(float) k);
        int y_step = ceil(y/(float) k);
        mini = min(x_step,y_step);
        maxi = max(y_step,x_step);
        cout << x_step + y_step + max(maxi - mini,0) - (x_step > y_step)<< endl; 
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation: 
We have to take extra steps whenever we have reached one endpoint and other is yet to achieve. One expection if x > y  we are alreay looking at +ve x direction so that we dont have to take one extra step, as we were already looking in same direction when at the start, so one (extra) step we dont have to make.
